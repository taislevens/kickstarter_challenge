# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Analyze the achievements versus initial goal of entertainment campaigns using charts, pivot tables and basic formulas in excel.

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to apply the knowledge obtained in the classes using certain tools on excel such as: formulas, pivot tables and charts.

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The total of theather projects launched from 2009 to 2017 were 1393 and 839 were successful, which means the total pledged amount was 100% or more higher than the goal amount, specially the ones created in the month o May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The total of plays projects were 1066 where 694 were successful and 353 were failed. When the goal for the campaigns were within $25,000 and $29,000, only 20% of the prjects were successfull. The total of 16 projects had the goal above $50,000 and out of the 18 projects, only 13% successed. Majority of the projects failed when the goal was set up at $1,000 to $4,999 and majority of successful projects had the goal within $0 and $4,999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
How to "clean" the graph when started from a pivot table (the filters were showing in the graph so it took me some time to find the clear filter)
The conditional formating when needs to be set up at certain threshold was also not so clear how to change but it was done correctly.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    Out of 1393 theather projects, 839 were successful and 493 were failed
    The concentration of successful projects were done in May from year 2009 to 2017

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    Majority of the projects failed when the goal was set up at $1,000 to $4,999 and majority of successful projects had the goal within $0 and $4,999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    In order to conclude the successful rate of a category, the outliers also needs to be considered. So, the perncetage can show 80% failed, as you can see in the range $5,000 or more, however, there were only 14 projects failed. THe results can be misleading depending on what information you need to show.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    First task: I would include in the pivot table the years, instead of using the months. Knowing the most of the projects were successful in the month of May but for all of the months, it might not be so useful information compared to knwing how many projexts were successed in the year of 2017(i.e.)
    I would create calculate the percentage by oucome instead of range. This is a good way of looking at the actual percentage of successful or failed projects.

    Numbers can be showed in various ways - it is very important to have an objective goal on how you want to show the information.
